											<b>What is behavioring anyway?</b>											
											<p class="margin-top-10px">												
												Yes. You are right. There is no such word called behaviouring in English.
												It's gramatically incorrect, just like Apple's <i>Think Different</i>.
											</p>
											<p class="margin-top-10px">
												Nevertheless behaviouring is a very special word for me. Why? Well. Just think of a computer or any electronic
												device. It's just a piece of silicon (<sub>14</sub>Si) packed inside a metal or a plastic. We call it hardware. It simply 
												lies there and doesn't know how to behave. It's creatures like me, the programmers who teach it what things to do 
												and how to do things. Thus adding behaviour(s) to otherwise a piece of silicon. 
											</p>
											<p class="margin-top-10px">
												And that is called behaviouring. Simple enough?

											<b>About me</b>											
											<p class="margin-top-10px">												
												When I was born, I was destined to be an engineer. And now I am.
											</p>
											<p class="margin-top-10px">	
												There is no particular field of engineering I like the most over the other. I like 
												them all. But I'm particularly wired to be a computer engineer.
												I respect every engineer who has worked and still working to make human life beautiful and meaningful by revealing the subtleties of our universe. 												
												From Nikola Tesla to Steve Wozniak, I love them all. In recent times the life of Steve Woz made a huge impact on me. 
												After reading his story (The book titled iWoz), I decided that I will learn, do and teach engineering for ever.
											</p>
											<p class="margin-top-10px">
											    I like to meet new people and plants and become friends with them. Not much of an animal lover.
												I consider myself a mystic person - the one who spends a lot of time in deep thoughts travelling
												through the star clusters of the cosmos.
												In my leisure time you can spot me at X-Fitness & Solid (17.399978, 78.414067) doing weight lifting or at Lotus Pond (17.413596, 78.420086) taking a stroll.
												And well you want to know my name? I am Mohan.

													scanner, remote mobile tracker & controller, call & sms blocker and privacy advisor. It was a startup project with a

                                                    I headed the app development team and was completely responsible for end to end coding, testing, troubleshooting and release management. I designed the core data structures, malware scan engine
													and data storage and retrieval logic. The project helped me learn a lot of core computer science concepts especially algorithm design and analysis, system programming, data communication and text processing.

                                                    Initially we started the project as Proof of Concept (PoC) for an improved and reliable malware detection method which is faster than legacy detection methods. 
													When we kicked off we did not have a name for the product. Later when we started development I came up with the suggestion <i>Rinix</i> because it is a very special word. <i>Ri</i> was taken from first two 
													letters of <i>Ritchie in Dennis Ritchie (The inventor of C programming language)</i> and <i>nix</i> was taken from last three letters of <i>Unix (The OS designed by Dennis Ritchie & Ken Thompson)</i>.
													It ended up a good word as it rhymes with Unix and other Unix family of names like Linux, Minix and so on.

                                                    We released Rinix as a free app on June 30, 2013. Thanks to its speed, light-weightness and rich features it gained traction so quickly from 
													users across the world. We reached 1 million count in less than 4 months time! Later we also released a paid version.
													After around 6 months from the release date Rinix was acquired by Rotella.

													That's the place where you (me too) see more than a 100 times in any given day. Yes there is a wallpaper but who set it? It's you and you set it
													some 2 weeks ago. And that's it. It's still there, lifeless. Of course there are live wallpapers to add life to it.
													But the choice of pictures offered by them is limited and they don't know what kind of pictures you like.

                                                    Ok. To understand, consider this scenario. I currently have a wallpaper on my phone which shows the picture of Gautama Buddha in deep meditation with a text below that reads <i>Each morning
													we are born again. What we do today is what matters the most.</i> Seeing the picture everytime makes me question if I'm spending
													this moment worth living. Hmmm.. that's a bit of philosophy. Please ignore it! I set that picture long back
													and after seeing that picture day in and day out for many many days, one day I thought <i>I like pictures of this sort. But my phone is not realizing that. Anyway It has
													enough time at night when I'm sleeping to think about it. Won't it be much better if it tries to find a similar picture on the internet and set that as the wallpaper and makes me feel happy when I wake up the next morning?</i>
                                                </p>
                                                <p class="margin-top-10px">
                                                    But my phone can't think on its own, right? So I'm currently teaching my phone how to do that.
													I thought if I would feel happy if my phone do that for me, a couple others might also feel happy if
													their phone could do that for them. And so it happened I started writing an Android app and thought <i>Ok. Let's call it Breathe</i>. I'm planning to release Breathe in late
													September or early November, 2015.
